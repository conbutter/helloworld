## Overview

**Project Title**: Hello World Outline

**Project Description**: A simple program that holds a string and repeats it upon command. Meant to act as a helpful baseline for a program menu structure that can be easily used as a template going forward.

**Project Goals**: To create an easily-reusable template for C# console applications that can be adapted for other programs going forward.
